// Reported by: DeltaMidway

//
// For those of you wondering what happened to HL-Paintball, well lemme
// tell you a story. The leader of HL-Paintball, Spawn, hadn't worked on
// the mod for quite some time so when the coder, ToonCop, left because he
// got busy in life - Spawn was left once again with the spotlight on him.
// After that, the interest in HLPB dropped a lot after no updates and no
// communication with the leader. Now HLPB fans are only left with a few
// stragglers that linger in the IRC channel. So if you totally missed the
// mod then you can still download it at FilePlanet.
